Description: The goal of DELocal is to identify DE genes compared to their 
    neighboring genes from the same chromosomal location. It has been shown
    that genes of related functions are generally very far from each other 
    in the chromosome. DELocal utilzes this information to identify DE genes
    comparing with their neighbouring genes.
